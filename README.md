> **Abstract** : A **Typing Speed Test** website is an interactive platform that allows users to assess their typing speed and accuracy. Users are typically presented with a passage of text and must type it as quickly and accurately as possible. The website calculates **Words Per Minute (WPM)** based on how many words the user can type in a set amount of time, usually one minute. Additionally, it measures **typing accuracy**, comparing the user's typed text with the provided passage to determine errors.

These websites often provide real-time feedback, including visual indicators like progress bars or timers. Some gamify the experience by comparing typing speeds to creatures (e.g., slow like a turtle, fast like a cheetah) to make it more engaging. Users can track their performance over multiple attempts, helping them improve their typing skills for both speed and accuracy over time.
